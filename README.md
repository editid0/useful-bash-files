# useful-bash-files
you can use these if you want, they're all for ubuntu linux, since that's what I use

Run `wget https://raw.githubusercontent.com/editid0/useful-bash-files/main/install.sh > install.sh`.

Next, run `bash install.sh numbers` where `numbers` is the list of numbers in each directory, with a comma between them.

e.g.
`bash install.sh 1,3,4`
